# Apocalypse Tales: Choose Your Survival 🧟‍♂️

A text-based zombie survival game concept that combines storytelling with player choices. Currently in early development with basic UI implementation.

> **Important Note**: This project is currently on hold due to API limitations. The AI story generation feature requires paid API keys (OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.), which makes it difficult to implement the full vision. The project is open-sourced in the hope that the community can help find solutions or alternative approaches.

## 🎮 Current State

The project currently has a basic implementation with:
- Chatbox UI for story progression
- Choice buttons for player decisions
- Custom choice input system
- Dark theme and responsive design

## 🚀 Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

### Story & Choices
- AI-Generated Narrative using GPT models
- Multiple Story Branches
- Custom Choice Input

### Survival Mechanics
- Hunger & Thirst System
- Group Management
- Morale System

### Visual Elements
- Dynamic Backgrounds
- Day-Night Cycle
- Weather Effects
- Inventory System
- Status Bars

### Technical Features
- User Authentication
- Database Integration
- Responsive Design
- Modular Architecture

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current)

### Implemented
- Next.js 14
- React 18
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

### Planned (Not Implemented)
- Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Database (MongoDB/Firebase)
- AI Integration (OpenAI GPT-4, DALL·E)
- WebGL for effects

## 🚧 Limitations

1. **AI Integration**
   - Requires paid API keys
   - Limited by API costs and quotas
   - No free alternative currently available

2. **Development Status**
   - Basic UI only
   - No backend implementation
   - No database integration
   - No AI features

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

The project is open-sourced with the hope that the community can help find solutions for:
1. Free or low-cost AI alternatives
2. Local AI model integration
3. Community-driven story content
4. Alternative approaches to dynamic storytelling
